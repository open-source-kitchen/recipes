I wanted something yummy, but didn't have much to work with.

Ingredients
-----------
- 2 Smoked Sausages (hotdogs)
- Splash of soy sauce
- Splash of maple syrup (not the artificial shit)
- Splash of sesame oil
- Pam cooking spray

Preparation
-----------
* Preheat a medium-sized pan with a flat bottom at medium heat on the stove.
* Slice the hotdogs into 1/4-inch diagonal slices, like they do the sausages at
  the Asian buffets. Cut at 45ยบ so the hotdogs become a bunch of little
  oval-shaped medallions with a lean.
* Spray some Pam cooking spray in the pan and let it heat up.

Cooking
-------
* Put the hotdogs in the pan.
* Simmer until the hotdogs start to swell.
* Add a splash of soy sauce and stir. Try to get an even coat.
* After a bit more cooking, add a touch of sesame oil.
* Stir more and try to get an even coat.
* Finally, add a splash of pure maple syrup, enough to coat the meat.
* Stir until properly coated, then raise the heat to high.
* With the heat on high, stir and flip the hotdogs so they have a nice amount of
  sear on their surfaces. We don't want to blacken them throughout, just sear
  the tops and bottoms a bit.
* Once hotdogs show sufficient sear, remove from heat, turn off appliances, and
  serve.
